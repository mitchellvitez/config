# config
For various dotfiles, installation scripts, and other setup I might want to do


## Installation

Download and install [iterm2](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html)

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/mitchellvitez/config.git
bash config/config.sh
```

Set iterm theme (preferences > profiles > colors) to "vital"

## Notes

The setup script was written for a mac setup with iterm2. It should work tolerably well on linux / cygwin, but isn't optimized for those cases.
